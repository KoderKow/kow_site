# Hello!

My name is Kyle Harris. I am senior at IUPUI. Completing a double major with a BS in Health Data Science and a BS in Informatics is on the horizon! My educational interests include data sceince, machine learning, and data visualization. I currently work with the data visualization research team at IUPUI as a research assistant. Over the summer I will be interning at ClusterTruck as a data scientist.

My personal hobbies include spending time with my girlfriend Lexi, petting my cats, playing video games, studying/reading about data science and machine learning. My current goals are to graduate in Spring 2019 and get accepted into a masters program for data science and/or machine learning.
