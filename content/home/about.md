# Hello!

My name is Kyle Harris. I am senior at IUPUI. Completing a double major with a BS in Health Data Science and a BS in Informatics is on the horizon! My educational interests include data sceince, machine learning, and data visualization. I currently work part time as a data scientist at ClusterTruck here in Indianapolis.

My personal hobbies include spending time with my girlfriend Lexi, petting my cats, playing video games, studying/reading about data science and machine learning, and listening to audio books. My current goals are to graduate in Spring 2019 and start working after my undergrad. I am looking for a company that values education and will allow me to continue my education for a masters while putting the knowledge I have learned through my undergrad to good use for their business.
